# C++ Invariant lib for primitive types
Warning: Don't use this lib. It's untested, unfinished etc.

Developed with Clang 3.8 Windows version.

C++17 features (like Fold Expressions) are used in the lib. In theory it should work:

Clang 3.6+
GCC 6+

MSVC: The latest msvc doesn't support fold expressions, so it won't work with it.
